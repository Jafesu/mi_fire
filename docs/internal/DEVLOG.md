# Development log

Append-only record of every working session. **Newest entries at the bottom.**

Never edit or delete an earlier entry. If a past entry turns out to be wrong, write a new
one saying so — the record of what we believed at the time is part of the value.

## Template

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD · session NNN

**Scope:** task IDs worked
**Changed:** the files that matter, not every file
**Decisions:** anything a later session could reverse by accident. Link the ADR if you wrote one.
**Verified:** what you actually ran, and the result. Say "not verified" if you did not.
**Open:** known-incomplete work, with task IDs
**Next:** the obvious next task
```

**Verified** is the field that matters. Write what you ran, not what you believe.
"Tests pass, not loaded in game yet" is useful. "works" is not.

## 2026-08-30 · session 001

**Scope:** `SETUP-001`…`SETUP-008`, `FIRE-001`

**Changed:** repository scaffold from empty. `fxmanifest.lua`, `.gitignore`,
`shared/{enums,util,hydraulics}.lua`, `config/{config,dispatch,zones,fire_classes,agents,gear}.lua`,
`bridge/framework/init.lua`, `bridge/dispatch/init.lua`, `bridge/target/ox_target.lua`,
`bridge/appearance/illenium.lua`, `bridge/inventory/ox_inventory.lua`,
`server/core/{state,permissions}.lua`, `server/main.lua`, `client/main.lua`,
`tools/run_tests.lua`, `tools/tests/hydraulics_spec.lua`, and the `docs/` tree.

**Decisions:**

- `shared/hydraulics.lua` is pure Lua with no game natives, so the pressure model can be
  tested outside FiveM. Every constant in it is a published fire service figure, not a
  tuning value — the comments name which. Tuning belongs in `config/hose.lua`.
- Real friction-loss coefficients, `Q = 29.7·d²·√NP` for smooth bore, NFPA 1901 pump
  curve, and the percent-drop rule for hydrant capacity. Two worked problems from the
  plan are asserted directly: 200 ft of 1.75″ at 150 gpm on a 100 psi fog nozzle gives
  PDP 169.75, and 500 ft of 5″ at 1000 gpm loses 40 psi.
- `config/agents.lua` allows **negative** effectiveness. Water on a Class D fire is −1.0
  and fires an explosion hazard. A script that clamps that to zero teaches the wrong
  lesson, so it does not.
- Gear grants resistance, never immunity. Enforced in three places: boot validation in
  `server/main.lua` refuses to start an invalid config, a test asserts every tier, and
  `config/gear.lua` says so at the top. Smoke has no gear field at all — SCBA is the only
  defence, by construction rather than by convention.
- Protection is read from `server/core/state.lua`, never from what a player is wearing.
  A turnout skin from a clothing menu grants nothing.
- Hazmat suits have *worse* fire resistance than turnout (Level A is 0.15 against
  structural's 0.75) and far better chemical resistance. That trade is real and the config
  should let you walk into it.
- Framework bridge auto-detects Qbox, then ESX, then falls back to standalone. Because of
  that, `qbx_core` was removed from `dependencies` in the manifest — hard-depending on it
  would break the two adapters that exist to avoid exactly that.
- `@oxmysql` removed from `server_scripts`: nothing persists yet, and a DB dependency that
  is not used is a dependency that breaks servers for no benefit.
- Dispatch goes to **lb-tablet**, not ejds-dispatchv2. Payload shape was read off a
  working integration in `mi_gunrunner/server/shipments.lua:151` rather than guessed. The
  provider abstraction matches `mi_gunrunner/config.lua` so the two configure alike.
- `docs/internal/` holds the engineering record; everything else in `docs/` is written for
  players and server owners, following the GitBook layout already used in `ejds-sl`.

**Verified:**

- `lua tools/run_tests.lua` — **94 passed, 0 failed**. Covers coefficients, friction loss
  including the parallel-line case, smooth bore and fog nozzle flow against published tip
  figures, elevation, appliance loss, five worked PDP problems, the pump curve, percent
  drop, cavitation, tank time, and the gear-immunity invariant.
- `luac -p` on all 21 Lua files — all parse.
- **Not** loaded in a running server yet. No in-game verification of any kind has been
  done; the resource has never been started. Everything above is static verification only.

**Open:**

- `FIRE-002`…`FIRE-010`: the node engine itself does not exist yet. Config describes
  behaviour nothing implements.
- No exports yet, so `mi_fire_rescue` cannot be repointed.
- District geometry is placeholder spheres. Real boundaries need `/district here` to walk,
  which needs the resource running.
- `config/gear.lua` appearance drawable IDs are all `-1`. They need the server's actual
  EUP pack, which is a Phase 2 job.

**Next:** `FIRE-002` — the fire node lifecycle in `server/modules/fire/`, then the
class/agent matrix applied to suppression, then exports.

## 2026-08-30 · session 002

**Scope:** `SETUP-009`, plus design for `PLACE-001`…`PLACE-003` and `STN-001`…`STN-006`

**Changed:** `install/migrations/0001_stations.sql`, `server/core/db.lua`,
`config/stations.lua`, `fxmanifest.lua`, `server/main.lua`,
`docs/internal/DATAMODEL.md`, `docs/internal/{BUILD,TASKS}.md`.

**Decisions:**

- Station configuration moves to MySQL. The split is not "important things in the
  database" — it is *things you edit in a text editor* versus *things you build by walking
  around*. Fire tuning wants to be diffed and copied between servers, so it stays a file.
  A speaker position wants to be placed by looking at a wall, so it is a row.
- One `mi_fire_station_points` table for every placed kind rather than one per kind. A
  light and a speaker differ only in what happens when the tones drop, so a new kind
  should be a row, not a migration.
- Placement is a raycast tool: aim at a surface, the preview snaps to the hit point and
  takes its rotation from the surface normal, so a wall-mounted speaker sits flat without
  anyone typing a rotation. Fine adjustment reuses the 6-DOF nudge from the offset finder.
- The offset finder and the station tool therefore share one gizmo in
  `client/modules/placement/`, rather than two that drift apart. That is why the placement
  tasks moved to the front of Phase 2 — Phase 6b depends on them.
- A polygon builder covers areas: walk the perimeter dropping vertices, close the loop,
  set the height. Station coverage is not a sphere, and pretending it is puts the tones in
  the car park. A station with no polygon falls back to a radius so it is useful
  immediately and the polygon is a refinement rather than a prerequisite.
- Presentation stays in `config/stations.lua` while position goes in the database. The row
  says *where a speaker is*; the config says *how loud speakers are*. Putting the second
  in the database would mean editing rows to retune audio.
- Station changes must hot-apply. Recorded as a verification step, not an aspiration.

**Correction to session 001:** that session removed `@oxmysql` from the manifest and
described the database integration as gracefully degrading. That was wrong.
`@oxmysql/lib/MySQL.lua` is a **load-time include** — without oxmysql the resource does
not start at all, so any claim of degradation would have been false. `oxmysql` is now a
declared hard dependency, which Qbox and ESX both require anyway. `server/core/db.lua`
still handles the genuinely different failure of oxmysql running but the database being
unreachable, and proves the connection with `SELECT 1` rather than trusting the resource
state — a started oxmysql with bad credentials looks identical to a working one until the
first real query fails somewhere less convenient.

**Verified:**

- `lua tools/run_tests.lua` — 94 passed, 0 failed. Unchanged; nothing this session touched
  the hydraulics.
- `luac -p` on all 22 Lua files — all parse.
- **Not** verified in game. The migration runner has never been executed against a real
  database, so `0001_stations.sql` is unproven — a syntax error in it would only surface on
  first boot. That is the first thing to check next session.

**Open:**

- Everything in Phase 1 remains untouched; the node engine still does not exist.
- `MIGRATIONS` in `db.lua` is a hand-maintained list. Adding a migration file without
  registering it there is a silent no-op, and nothing currently catches that.
- The statement splitter is naive: it splits on semicolons after stripping line comments.
  Any migration needing a stored procedure or trigger would break it.

**Next:** `FIRE-002` — the node lifecycle. The database work is foundation, not progress
toward a playable fire.

## 2026-08-30 · session 003

**Scope:** `SETUP-010`, plus design for `SPK-001`…`SPK-009`

**Changed:** `config/sprinklers.lua`, `install/migrations/0002_sprinklers.sql`,
`shared/enums.lua`, `server/core/db.lua`, `fxmanifest.lua`,
`tools/tests/sprinklers_spec.lua`, `tools/run_tests.lua`, `docs/internal/DATAMODEL.md`,
`docs/internal/{BUILD,TASKS,CHANGELOG}.md`.

**Decisions:**

- Sprinklers get their **own tables**, not `mi_fire_station_points`. The request framed
  them as station config, and they do share the placement tooling and the MySQL-backed
  pattern — but a station is fire department property whose rows are static presentation,
  while a sprinkler system is building infrastructure carrying live state. Squeezing state
  into the points table would have meant a `metadata` blob doing the work of real columns.
- That live state is the second reason sprinklers belong in the database at all: water
  remaining, which heads have fused, whether the system is in service. **A server restart
  is not a reset.**
- One row per head, because heads operate **individually** — only the ones that get hot
  enough fuse. This is the detail fiction always gets wrong, and it is what makes an
  activation readable on scene. Storing a system as a single coverage volume would have
  lost exactly the behaviour worth having.
- Head flow uses the real orifice formula `Q = K·√P`, the same relationship as a smooth
  bore nozzle. K5.6 at 15 psi lands on the published 21.7 gpm.
- Systems discharge through the **existing agent matrix**, so a water system over a
  commercial kitchen makes a Class K fire worse. Not special-cased away — it is why real
  kitchens have wet-chemical hood systems, and it makes installing the right system a
  decision rather than a formality. Tested directly.
- The **fire department connection** is the tactical payoff and the reason this is not
  scenery: when the tank runs dry, a crew that lays a line to the FDC keeps the heads
  flowing off the engine at 45 psi instead of the tank's 15. That ties sprinklers into the
  Phase 5 supply work, so `SPK-007` depends on it.
- The **waterflow alarm is the call**. A protected building generates its own dispatch
  after a retard timer, which is a genuinely different feel from a passer-by phoning it in.
  Running dry with fire still burning escalates, because the building just lost its
  protection.
- Reset is five ox_target steps with replacement heads as an inventory item, and
  `autoResetSeconds` is deliberately `nil`. Nothing quietly fixes a system on a timer.
- Placed at **Phase 6c**, after station alerting. It needs the placement gizmo (Phase 2),
  the suppression model (Phase 1), and Phase 5 for the FDC.

**Verified:**

- `lua tools/run_tests.lua` — **136 passed, 0 failed** (94 hydraulics, 42 sprinkler).
- Sprinkler flow asserted against the published K5.6 figure, and the square-root
  relationship checked directly rather than assumed.
- The design invariant is now a test, not a comment: two heads run 17 minutes on the
  default tank, six drain it in under six, and even the largest configurable tank cannot
  outlast an hour of serious flow. A tuning change that turned sprinklers into a win
  button would fail the suite.
- `luac -p` on all 24 Lua files — all parse.
- **Not** verified in game. Neither migration has ever run against a real database, so
  both `0001_stations.sql` and `0002_sprinklers.sql` remain unproven — a syntax error in
  either would only surface on first boot.

**Open:**

- Phase 1 is still untouched. Three sessions of foundation and configuration; no fire has
  ever burned.
- `activationHeat` values are calibrated against a heat scale that `EXPO-001` has not
  built yet. They are reasonable-looking numbers on an axis with no implementation, and
  will almost certainly need retuning once heat actually accumulates.
- Sprinkler suppression assumes `FIRE-005` will expose a way to apply an agent to nodes in
  a radius. That interface does not exist yet.

**Next:** `FIRE-002`, the node lifecycle. Foundation is well ahead of the engine now, and
the gap should close before more configuration is written.
