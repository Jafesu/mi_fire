# Development log

Append-only record of every working session. **Newest entries at the bottom.**

Never edit or delete an earlier entry. If a past entry turns out to be wrong, write a new
one saying so — the record of what we believed at the time is part of the value.

## Template

```md
## YYYY-MM-DD · session NNN

**Scope:** task IDs worked
**Changed:** the files that matter, not every file
**Decisions:** anything a later session could reverse by accident. Link the ADR if you wrote one.
**Verified:** what you actually ran, and the result. Say "not verified" if you did not.
**Open:** known-incomplete work, with task IDs
**Next:** the obvious next task
```

**Verified** is the field that matters. Write what you ran, not what you believe.
"Tests pass, not loaded in game yet" is useful. "works" is not.

## 2026-08-30 · session 001

**Scope:** `SETUP-001`…`SETUP-008`, `FIRE-001`

**Changed:** repository scaffold from empty. `fxmanifest.lua`, `.gitignore`,
`shared/{enums,util,hydraulics}.lua`, `config/{config,dispatch,zones,fire_classes,agents,gear}.lua`,
`bridge/framework/init.lua`, `bridge/dispatch/init.lua`, `bridge/target/ox_target.lua`,
`bridge/appearance/illenium.lua`, `bridge/inventory/ox_inventory.lua`,
`server/core/{state,permissions}.lua`, `server/main.lua`, `client/main.lua`,
`tools/run_tests.lua`, `tools/tests/hydraulics_spec.lua`, and the `docs/` tree.

**Decisions:**

- `shared/hydraulics.lua` is pure Lua with no game natives, so the pressure model can be
  tested outside FiveM. Every constant in it is a published fire service figure, not a
  tuning value — the comments name which. Tuning belongs in `config/hose.lua`.
- Real friction-loss coefficients, `Q = 29.7·d²·√NP` for smooth bore, NFPA 1901 pump
  curve, and the percent-drop rule for hydrant capacity. Two worked problems from the
  plan are asserted directly: 200 ft of 1.75″ at 150 gpm on a 100 psi fog nozzle gives
  PDP 169.75, and 500 ft of 5″ at 1000 gpm loses 40 psi.
- `config/agents.lua` allows **negative** effectiveness. Water on a Class D fire is −1.0
  and fires an explosion hazard. A script that clamps that to zero teaches the wrong
  lesson, so it does not.
- Gear grants resistance, never immunity. Enforced in three places: boot validation in
  `server/main.lua` refuses to start an invalid config, a test asserts every tier, and
  `config/gear.lua` says so at the top. Smoke has no gear field at all — SCBA is the only
  defence, by construction rather than by convention.
- Protection is read from `server/core/state.lua`, never from what a player is wearing.
  A turnout skin from a clothing menu grants nothing.
- Hazmat suits have *worse* fire resistance than turnout (Level A is 0.15 against
  structural's 0.75) and far better chemical resistance. That trade is real and the config
  should let you walk into it.
- Framework bridge auto-detects Qbox, then ESX, then falls back to standalone. Because of
  that, `qbx_core` was removed from `dependencies` in the manifest — hard-depending on it
  would break the two adapters that exist to avoid exactly that.
- `@oxmysql` removed from `server_scripts`: nothing persists yet, and a DB dependency that
  is not used is a dependency that breaks servers for no benefit.
- Dispatch goes to **lb-tablet**, not ejds-dispatchv2. Payload shape was read off a
  working integration in `mi_gunrunner/server/shipments.lua:151` rather than guessed. The
  provider abstraction matches `mi_gunrunner/config.lua` so the two configure alike.
- `docs/internal/` holds the engineering record; everything else in `docs/` is written for
  players and server owners, following the GitBook layout already used in `ejds-sl`.

**Verified:**

- `lua tools/run_tests.lua` — **94 passed, 0 failed**. Covers coefficients, friction loss
  including the parallel-line case, smooth bore and fog nozzle flow against published tip
  figures, elevation, appliance loss, five worked PDP problems, the pump curve, percent
  drop, cavitation, tank time, and the gear-immunity invariant.
- `luac -p` on all 21 Lua files — all parse.
- **Not** loaded in a running server yet. No in-game verification of any kind has been
  done; the resource has never been started. Everything above is static verification only.

**Open:**

- `FIRE-002`…`FIRE-010`: the node engine itself does not exist yet. Config describes
  behaviour nothing implements.
- No exports yet, so `mi_fire_rescue` cannot be repointed.
- District geometry is placeholder spheres. Real boundaries need `/district here` to walk,
  which needs the resource running.
- `config/gear.lua` appearance drawable IDs are all `-1`. They need the server's actual
  EUP pack, which is a Phase 2 job.

**Next:** `FIRE-002` — the fire node lifecycle in `server/modules/fire/`, then the
class/agent matrix applied to suppression, then exports.
